Python Book Recomandation Project

It contains some Data Analyses and a Web aplication for book recommendation from the used DataFrame.

Sure, I'll create a README file for your project after examining all the files. Here's the README:

Book Recommendation Web App
This is a Flask web application that recommends books based on user-selected tags. The application uses a dataset of books, tags, and book-tag mappings to filter and recommend books.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
Pandas
NumPy
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install flask pandas numpy

data/: Directory containing the CSV data files (tags, book_tags, and books).
Running the Application
Clone or download the project repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Make sure the CSV data files (tags.csv, book_tags.csv, and books.csv) are present in the data/ directory.
Update the file paths in app.py to match the locations of the CSV data files on your system.
Run the Flask application:
python app.py

Open your web browser and visit (Local Host URL Example) to access the Book Recommendation Web App.
Usage
On the initial page, click the "Get Recommendation" button to navigate to the recommendation form.
Select a tag from the dropdown list.
Click the "Submit" button to get a book recommendation based on the selected tag.
The recommended book title will be displayed on the result page.
